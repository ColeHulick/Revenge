Forest
You reach the edge of the forest as you stand in front of tightly knit trees. You stare deep into the darkness ahead as if begging permission to enter. You slowly step into the massive realm of woodland and from the first footfall the whole atmosphere changes. The ground was spongy; the earth gently hugs your boots with each step. You look ahead and find a large dark oak tree. Its roots spread throughout the ground as if it were veins, almost as if it is the heart of the entire forest.

Forest
You reach the edge of the forest as you stand in front of tightly knit trees. You stare deep into the darkness ahead as if begging permission to enter. You slowly step into the massive realm of woodland and from the first footfall the whole atmosphere changes. The ground was spongy; the earth gently hugs your boots with each step. You look ahead and find a large dark oak tree. Its roots spread throughout the ground as if it were veins, almost as if it is the heart of the entire forest.

Forest
You reach the edge of the forest as you stand in front of tightly knit trees. You stare deep into the darkness ahead as if begging permission to enter. You slowly step into the massive realm of woodland and from the first footfall the whole atmosphere changes. The ground was spongy; the earth gently hugs your boots with each step. You look ahead and find a large dark oak tree. Its roots spread throughout the ground as if it were veins, almost as if it is the heart of the entire forest.

It screaches out a roar and stares right into your eyes. Your heart starts rapidly speeding up! YOU NEED TO SLAY THE DRAGON NOW!

Fierce eyes sit deep within the dragon's skull. Two horns sit atop its head, several rows of small crystal growths run down the dragons spine. Colossal wings grow from its side, large ruby scales cover the dragon's body.

It screeches out a roar and stares right into your eyes. Your heart starts rapidly speeding up! YOU NEED TO SLAY THE DRAGON NOW!

Fierce eyes sit deep within the dragon's skull. Two horns sit atop its head, several rows of small crystal growths run down the dragon's spine. Colossal wings grow from its side; large ruby scales cover the dragon's body.

Forest
You reach the edge of the forest as you stand in front of tightly knit trees. You stare deep into the darkness ahead as if begging permission to enter. You slowly step into the massive realm of woodland and from the first footfall the whole atmosphere changes. The ground was spongy; the earth gently hugs your boots with each step. You look ahead and find a large dark oak tree. Its roots spread throughout the ground as if it were veins, almost as if it is the heart of the entire forest.

You reach the edge of the forest as you stand in front of tightly knit trees. You stare deep into the darkness ahead as if begging permission to enter. You slowly step into the massive realm of woodland and from the first footfall the whole atmosphere changes. The ground was spongy; the earth gently hugs your boots with each step. You look ahead and find a large dark oak tree. Its roots spread throughout the ground as if it were veins, almost as if it is the heart of the entire forest.

As you take each step the whole atmosphere begins to change, as if a dark powerfull presence is watching your everystep. You soon reach the top of the tower, the wind blows rapidly into your face and clouds begin to form above you blocking out the sun. You look ahead and see the Dragon! It screaches out a roar and stares right into your eyes. Your heart starts rapidly speeding up! YOU NEED TO SLAY THE DRAGON NOW!

Fierce eyes sit deep within the dragon's skull. Two horns sit atop its head, several rows of small crystal growths run down the dragons spine. Colossal wings grow from its side, large ruby scales cover the dragon's body.

You reach the edge of the forest as you stand in front of tightly knit trees. You stare deep into the darkness ahead as if begging permission to enter.

You look ahead and find a large dark oak tree. Its roots spread throughout the ground as if it were veins, almost as if it is the heart of the entire forest.

It screaches out a roar and stares right into your eyes. Your heart starts rapidly speeding up! YOU NEED TO SLAY THE DRAGON NOW!

Fierce eyes sit deep within the dragon's skull. Two horns sit atop its head, several rows of small crystal growths run down the dragons spine. Colossal wings grow from its side, large ruby scales cover the dragon's body.

Cellar
The door slowly creaks open, a musty smell fills your nose. The outdoor sunlight fills the darkend room. As your eyes adjust something shiny grabs your attention. You walk towards it and wipe off the thick layer of dust settling on the item, and notice its Chainmail armour.

Top of tower
As you take each step the whole atmosphere begins to change, as if a dark powerfull presence is watching your everystep. You soon reach the top of the tower, the wind blows rapidly into your face and clouds begin to form above you blocking out the sun. You look ahead and see the Dragon! It screaches out a roar and stares right into your eyes. Your heart starts rapidly speeding up! YOU NEED TO SLAY THE DRAGON NOW!

Fierce eyes sit deep within the dragon's skull. Two horns sit atop its head, several rows of small crystal growths run down the dragons spine. Colossal wings grow from its side, large ruby scales cover the dragon's body.

Welcome to the town of Draycott. Crops are burnt to a crisp and livestalk is at an all time low. Houses are in ashes and there are no townspeople to be seen. As you head near the end of the town you see your Master Zyliath, you should go talk to him.

Forest
You reach the edge of the forest as you stand in front of tightly knit trees. You stare deep into the darkness ahead as if begging permission to enter. You slowly step into the massive realm of woodland and from the first footfall the whole atmosphere changes. The ground was spongy; the earth gently hugs your boots with each step. You look ahead and find a large dark oak tree. Its roots spread throughout the ground as if it were veins, almost as if it is the heart of the entire forest.

Deep Crevice
Suddenly the trail ends. You look down and find a deep crevice with dark blue water rushing through it. As you look ahead you can see the Tower in the distance, this might be the time to use that spell you found.

Forest
You reach the edge of the forest as you stand in front of tightly knit trees. You stare deep into the darkness ahead as if begging permission to enter. You slowly step into the massive realm of woodland and from the first footfall the whole atmosphere changes. The ground was spongy; the earth gently hugs your boots with each step. You look ahead and find a large dark oak tree. Its roots spread throughout the ground as if it were veins, almost as if it is the heart of the entire forest.

Forest
You reach the edge of the forest as you stand in front of tightly knit trees. You stare deep into the darkness ahead as if begging permission to enter. You slowly step into the massive realm of woodland and from the first footfall the whole atmosphere changes. The ground was spongy; the earth gently hugs your boots with each step. You look ahead and find a large dark oak tree. Its roots spread throughout the ground as if it were veins, almost as if it is the heart of the entire forest.

Forest
You reach the edge of the forest as you stand in front of tightly knit trees. You stare deep into the darkness ahead as if begging permission to enter. You slowly step into the massive realm of woodland and from the first footfall the whole atmosphere changes. The ground was spongy; the earth gently hugs your boots with each step. You look ahead and find a large dark oak tree. Its roots spread throughout the ground as if it were veins, almost as if it is the heart of the entire forest.
